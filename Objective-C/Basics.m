/*
Objective-C is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language. OOP means that the language supports:
    * Encapsulation
    * Data hiding
    * Inheritance
    * Polymorphism
This guide will take you through the basics of Objective-C, rather quickly, as a refresher for those who have gone to Swift and never thought to look back.

// Swift usually imports UIKit, with Objective-C we want to make sure we import the foundation framework.
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
// The Foundation Framework contains Collection types, a lot of string manipulation methods and other basic mathematical methods and many other basic and necessary features.

// When workin in Objective-C it is important to remember the core syntax and nuances that make it function. I will make sure to annotate when we encounter such syntaxes but the first one I will mention is the semi-colon. Objective C statements/lines end with a semi-colon. `;`

/*  Anonther syntax to know `\\ Inline Comments` and Multi-line-comments. (Started above and closed below. Forward slash * to start and * Back Slash to end.)

/* 
*Types*

// When defining variables, you indicate the type so the program can allocate the proper amount of space to create the variable. You can define and/or initialize a variable in a single line of code. Here are some examples of defining variables.

// Three integers defined named 'a', 'b', 'c'
int a, b, c;

// A definition of char named 'cha'
char cha;

// A definition of float named 'totalAmount'
float totalAmount;

//An Initialization and definition of a float and char.
float totalPayment = 12.53;
char initial = 'E';

// There is a keyword `extern` that allows you to declare a variable somewhere in the program and then initialize/define the variable at some other point.

// Declaration (comes before/ outside of main func)
extern int age;
// Definition and initialization
int age = 23;

// Constants/Literals: Values that once declared and defined are unchangeable (a `let` Swift Equivalent) We can use `#define VARNAME value` (there is no semi-colon in #define statements) or we can use `const type varName = value;`
#define PI 3.14159

const float PI_6 = 3.141592;

const bool isTRUE = true;

// To print something to the console in Swift one would use print(), in Objective-C we log things to the console in the same way. `NSLog(@"string input to print and a formatter if necessary like a number %d, or a character like %c", integerForString, characterForString); Make sure to remember the `@` which comes before string literals.

NSLog(@"Here is a number %d and a character %c", age, initial);

// Strings: The best way to create a string is using the `@` construct.
// We state the type: NSString use a pointer when naming the variable *stringVar = @"String.";

NSString *helloWorld = @"Hello World";
NSString *upperHelloWorld = [helloWorld uppercaseString];

// Let's initialize integers a, b and c that we defined earlier and then put them in an integer array and get a feel for Objective-C arrays.

a = 1;
b = 2;
c = 3;

// We will first create an integer array with size 3. The formatting for this is: `type arrayName [intSizeOfArray];

int arrayABC [3];
arrayABC = {a, b, c};

// We could also not define a size and create an array like this:

float floatingArray [] = {0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};

// A constant array (a swift let equivalent) looks like the following:
NSArray *recordTempsInFar = @[@90, @85, @97];
// Notice the `@` symbol that comes before objects.

// Making an array Mutable means it is changeable.
NSMutableArray *array = [NSMutableArray new];
[array addObject: floatingArray];
// TODO: Check.
// Another collection type is a Dictionary
NSDictionary *abcGreekokay = @{ @"A": @"Alpha", @"B": @:"Beta", @"C": @"Gamma" };

// We could log the first element in the array like this:
NSLog(@"The first element in the array is %f", floatingArray[0]);
