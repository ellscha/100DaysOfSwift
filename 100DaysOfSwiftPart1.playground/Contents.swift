//100 Days of Swift P1.

/// #Day 1

///Definitely a review of things I know, one thing I _did_ learn is that you can write numbers with `_`s in them so that it keeps them clearer.
///e.g `var million = 1_000_000` is easier to read than just `var million = 1000000`.
///I will recap all lessons regardless of level just so I have everything in one repo for anyone who cares to peep.

///Declaring constants  vs variables. Constants cannot be changed (the value they are given is the value they remain). Whereas variables (as the name would suggest) _can_ vary in value. I will begin by declaring a constant string called placeOfBiirth as someone's place of birth is a constant (you cannot change where you were born, only maybe lie about it.) I will let declare a variable called age.

// Constant placeOfBirth
let placeOfBirth = "USA"

// Variable age (can change)
var age = 23

///String and Integers. Notice the variables above, placeOfBirth is a String and age is an Integer. One great thing about Swift is that it is a type-safe language, every variable (and constant (also considered a variable in the grand scheme of things)) must be a single specific type. String and Integer are two possible types. Trying to change `age = "23"` would be illegal because `"23"` is not an Int and the variable `age` must contain an integer value because that is how it was declared.

///If you have a string that should span multiple lines rather than using `"` (double quotes) you should you `"""` to begin and end quotes. _It is important to keep the `"""`s on their own line separate from the text that composes the string.

var haiku =
"""

"""

///Even though it looks different than other strings, the variable `haiku` still has the same type as placeOfBirth: `String`. Two other types are Doubles and Booleans. A Double is one of the number-type values in swift. Doubles are different than Integers because Doubles contain a decimal point. You cannot change an Int into a Double the same way you cannot change a Double into an Integer.

var euler = 2.71828

/// A Boolean is a `true` or `false` value.

var isCorrect = true

///Say you want to make a string that contains the value of age, but you don't know what age is at that moment in time...Enter String Interpolation. I will demonstrate below the opportunities string interpolation gives us.

print("Today I am \(age)")
print("Tomorrow is my birthday and I will be \(age + 1)")

/// The format of enclosnig a variable to interpolate into a String is `\(value)`.
/// The final lesson for Day 1 in 100 Days Of Swift is Type Inference. In the examples above, Swift knows what type each value is without me having to tell, this is called type-inference. You can, however, be explicit when creating variables. This is probably the most in depth I will be going into any specific lesson. I will leave detailed comments as requested or as I see fit for my own personal learning.

/// Arrays store values as they are entered and order _does_ matter.

// Arrays
let zero = 0
let one = 1
let two = 2
let three = 3

// This array is an array of type [Int]
let zeroToThree = [zero, one, two, three]

// You can access items in the array by using the index of the item you want in the array. Indices begin at value 0 (The first element in the array is at index 0).

var firstItemInArray = zeroToThree[0]

/// Sets! A set unlike an array does not maintain its order and does not retain duplicates. If you storing names of students in a class I'd recommend using an array because you may have more than one "Luke" in the class.


let ikeaShoppingListSet1: Set = (["Chair", "Table", "Couch"])
let ikeaShoppingListSet2 = Set(["Chair", "Table", "Couch", "Chair"])

// Both sets above end up being the same

/// Tuples are ordered pairs (or more than two values) that can be accessed using either their index or their property name (that you set).

let chairsToBuy = (furniture: "Chair", amount: 2)
let numberOfChairs = chairsToBuy.amount // Could have also done chairsToBuy.1
let itemToBuy = chairsToBuy.0

// Dictionaries are closer to arrays. They are key value pairs where the keys must be unique. They are similar to arrays except instead of using indices to access items you can use anything (either the key or the value).
var itemsToBuyAtIkea : [String: String] = [
    "Chair": "2",
    "Table": "1",
    "Couch": "1"

/// To initialize an empty collection using any of these types do the following:

//Array
var gradeValues = [Int]()

//Set
var possibleGrades = Set<Double>()

//Dictionary
var grades = [String: Double]()
grades["Elli"] = 100.0
print(grades)

//Tuple
print("Just kidding! There is no such thing as an empty tuple.")

/// *ENUMERATIONS* I'm excited to finally understand enums!
/// Enums are a way of defining states or related values.

enum GameStatus: Int {
    case win
    case loss
    case inProgress
}

let currentGame = GameStatus.inProgress

// That's great, but let's go one step furthr.
enum waterPoloGameStatus {
    case win(byPoints: Int)
    case loss(letsBlame: String)
    case inProgress
}

let earlierGame = waterPoloGameStatus.win(byPoints: 12)

// enums also add raw values like so:

enum tournamentStandings: Int {
    case gold = 1
    case silver
    case bronze
}

var thirdPrize = tournamentStandings(rawValue: 3)


/// #Day 3
/// MATH!!! I was, admittedly, a Mathlete in high school. With that, let's begin.
/// `+, -, *, / and % ` I will write it out as an enum just so we can review.

enum operators: String {
    case add = "+"
    case subtract = "-"
    case multiply = "*"
    case divide = "/"
    case modulo = "%"
}

var stringAboutAdding = "2 \(operators.add.rawValue) 2 = \(2+2)"

/// The `%` operator returns the remainer of a division problem 100 % 26 will return 22 because 26 goes into 100 3 times with a remainder of 22

var modulo = 100 % 26

/// You can use + to add more than numbers, you can add string or even arrays (if they have the same type).

let zeroToFive = zeroToThree + [4,5]

let checkYourself = haiku + "\nI hope that's the right amount of syllables!"

/// The  `/n` is a way to format a string as to say new line or return carriage
print(checkYourself)

//Another way we could've written the previous variable is with a compound operator: += I could change the value stored in haiku. (If the point is to create a new variable so that you still have access to the original do not use compound var)

var badHaiku = haiku
badHaiku += "oops, now it's not a haiku."

/// Comparative Operators. You can compare numbers, truthiness, strings, anything your heart desires (not really, but you know).

// != is not equals
tournamentStandings.gold.rawValue != tournamentStandings.silver.rawValue
// BUT
tournamentStandings.gold.rawValue == GameStatus.loss.rawValue
// That one is tricky but hopefully gives you a little insight into how indices work and when you saw a raw value vs letting swift make its own raw value (starting at 0).

/// You can also check less than `<` and greater `>` than as well as `<=` and `>=` less than or equal to and greater thanor equal to. You can use those operators on strings to check for alphabetization! (I didn't know that before!)

/// CONDITIONALS
/// I like all of the examples used in 100 Days of Swift, but I particularly like the examples used in this segment.

let firstCard = 11
let secondCard = 10

if firstCard + secondCard == 21 {
    print("Blackjack!")
}

/// The code inside of the `{}` braces get executed if the condition is true, you can also create a backup plan if there is something specific you want to do using ` else` and if it is a case you want to make non binary (more than true or false) conditional you can use `else if` with it's own conditional statement

if firstCard + secondCard == 2 {
    print("Aces â€“ lucky!")
} else if firstCard + secondCard == 21 {
    print("Blackjack!")
} else {
    print("Regular cards")
}

/// We can combine conditional statements use logic gates of OR `||` and AND `&&`

if firstCard >= 10 && secondCard >= 10 {
    print("These cards add up to at least 20")
}

if firstCard <= 10 || secondCard <= 10 {
    print("At least one of these cards is less than or equal to 10")
}

/// There is another operator called the ternary operator which can be used instead of an if else statement like so:

//Instead of
if firstCard == secondCard {
    print("Cards are the same")
} else {
    print("Cards are different")
}
// Using ternary operator you could simplify this to
print(firstCard == secondCard ? "Cards are the same" : "Cards are different")

/// SWITCH STATEMENTS!
/// If and if else are great, but when you have a lot of cases a switch statement is the way to go. Switch statements must be exhaustive, there should never be a conditional that falls through or doesn't meet any of the provided cases so you should provide a _default_ value.

let suit = "spade"

switch suit {
case "hearts":
    print("queen of hearts")
case "spades":
    print("ace of spades")
case "diamonds":
    print("eight of diamonds")
case "clubs":
    print("nine of clubs")
default:
    print("aces high")
}

/// Here is a switch statement that also usese a `fallthrough` this example utilizes string concatenation and switch and interpolation!
let integerToDescribe = 2
var description = "The number \(integerToDescribe) is"
switch integerToDescribe {

    description += " a prime number, and also"
    fallthrough
default:
    description += " an integer."
}
print(description)
// Prints "The number 5 is a prime number, and also an integer."

/// Range operators, let's say you want to check if someone got a grade  0 through 50, or 50 through 85 you can use range operators.
/// `x..<y` is non inclusive of `y` rather:`[x,y)` if that tickles your fancy. Whereas `x...y` is an inclusive range x to y or `[x,y]`.

let score = 62
